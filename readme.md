# AI-ce Attorney

Bot that generates ace attorney scripts and converts them into video using objection engine. Nothing fancy, just playing around with GPT-x type models.

Objection engine from [here](https://github.com/LuisMayo/objection_engine), but lightly altered to fit my own code (hence it is not installed as a submodule here).
